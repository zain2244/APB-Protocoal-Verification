# APB Protocol Verification using UVM

## Overview
This project implements a **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench** for verifying the **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol**. It includes test scenarios, functional coverage, and assertions to ensure APB compliance.

## Features
- **UVM Testbench** for APB verification
- **Assertions and functional coverage** to validate protocol compliance
- **Constrained-random and directed test cases**
- **Waveform debugging and log analysis** using Synopsys VCS
